    isunique="yes"
    description="The Boating skill covers the operation of small floating craft on rivers, lakes, and close inshore. Appropriate vessels are generally boats, canoes or rafts which travel short distances, and are unsuited to the rigours of the open sea. Most are propelled using oars, paddles, punts or simple sails; or can even be towed by animals. Ships with large crews or designed for long, overseas journeys are covered under the Seamanship professional skill.{br}The skill measures a character’s competence in propelling a boat in the right direction and dealing with adverse conditions. With no distractions and optimal conditions, a Boating roll is unnecessary, although lesser skilled characters may take longer to get where they need to as they manage the boat’s handling.{br}A critical Boating success increases the vessel’s Movement rate by one tenth.{br}A failed Boating roll implies the boat’s movement rate is halved or it failed to reach its intended destination; for instance navigating to an isolated rock positioned above a waterfall.{br}A fumbled Boating roll indicates losing an oar, taking on water or some other serious inconvenience. If the weather is bad or the water violent, then a fumble causes the boat to capsize.">

    description="Drive covers the control of wheeled or drawn vehicles, whether by one or more beasts of burden or more esoteric means: such as carts, carriages, chariots or sleds. Drive rolls are needed when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle – traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, and so on. A roll is also necessary if the vehicle being driven is drawn by different beasts than the driver is used to (horses instead of oxen, for example) or there are more or fewer beasts teamed together to pull the vehicle (a fourhorse wagon when the character is used to a two-horse team). In cases where either the beasts or their number are radically unfamiliar, a tiger drawn chariot for example, then the roll should be made more difficult.{br}Where two or more vehicles are contesting with each other, perhaps to overtake or force another off the road, the drivers should determine the result with an opposed Drive test.">

  <!-- Evade (DEX x2) Skill -->
  <thing
    id="skEvade"

    isunique="yes"
    description="Evade is used to escape from observed, impending danger, and can be used against ranged weapons (by diving for cover, for example), avoiding traps, changing the engagement distance in combat, and generally getting out of the way of a potential physical hazard. It can also be used as a resistance roll for certain types of magic. Usually Evade will be opposed by another roll, but it may also be a standard roll in its own right. Trying to negate damage by leaping clear of a crashing vehicle, as mentioned in the Drive skill, is an example of a standard Evade roll. The typical circumstances for opposed rolls are as follows:{br}{br}Avoiding Missiles{br}Evade is opposed by the Combat Style of the attacker.{br}{br}Thwarting a Trap{br}Evade is opposed either by the trap’s Potency or its original designer’s skill rating at the time the trap was made or set.{br}{br}Evading a Harmful Spell{br}Opposed by the spell caster’s score in the casting skill.{br}{br}Manoeuvering in Combat{br}Opposed by the attacker’s Evade skill.{br}{br}Again, like Endurance, Evade is most often used in Opposed Tests. When used as a standard test, a critical Evade roll ensures that the evader retains some form of advantage or composure afterwards, such as avoiding all damage or slipping completely clear of further danger.">
